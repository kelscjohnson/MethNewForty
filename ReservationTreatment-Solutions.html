						<p class=story><span class="dropcap">M</span>iranda Kirk stepped out of a dusty car in front of her office on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation to find two women waiting for her.
						</p>

						<p class="story">
It was early afternoon, and she had spent all morning racing across the Hi-Line, trying to find new clothes for one of them.
						</p>

						<p class="story">
She hands over a plastic bag filled with second-hand shirts and dresses. The woman’s clothes were stolen the night before.
						</p>
						<p class="story">
 “You have to keep your phone on during the night because addiction don't sleep and normally we don't either,” Kirk said.
						</p>
						<p class="story">

At 27, she has already lived a lot of life. She is the mother of four young kids. She is in remission from cancer. And she’s a case manager of sorts for recovering addicts who live on or near Fort Belknap.

						</p>

						<p class="story">
Kirk doesn’t have a formal degree in substance abuse treatment or counseling, but that didn’t stop her from starting the Aaniiih Nakoda Anti-Drug Movement, one of the first native-led peer recovery projects in Montana.
						</p>

						<p class="story">
The program is also the only option for recovering addicts on Fort Belknap  who need long-term and consistent support after getting out of treatment.
						</p>

						<p class="story">
“We’re kind of like the aftercare,” Kirk said. “We're helping them navigate into treatment and then being able to carry services when they come back. Because we don't have aftercare services. And there's no resources for aftercare.”

						</p>

						<p class="story">That’s a big deal because drug and alcohol addiction is more than a casual problem here. While many believe that Montana tackled its methamphetamine epidemic for a while in the 2000s, on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, home to the Aaniiih and Nakoda, or Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribes, meth and other illicit drug use never went away.
						</p>

						<p class="story">It’s hard to pin down exactly just how prevalent substance abuse is for specific native populations. Tribes are hesitant to release the data, if they have it, for good reason. It’s been misrepresented too many times.
						</p>

						<p class="story">But according to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, American Indian populations were almost twice as likely to need drug and alcohol treatment as other racial or ethnic groups. And a 2006 report from the National Congress of American Indians said that on reservations and rural native communities, methamphetamine abuse rates can be as high as 30 percent. (HYPERLINK HERE)

						</p>

						<p class="story">Kirk says, at least where she lives, she sees that it’s getting worse. People used to try and hide the problem. Now, “getting high in your car in front of the store - that ain't a big deal,” she said. “Or leaving your paraphernalia out in the open - that's alright. Seeing needles everywhere. That's ok. Even talking about selling your needles - that's normal too.”


						</p>

						<p class="story">One major factor is geography. Fort Belknap, about 40 miles south of the Canadian border, is isolated, but according to George Horse Capture, Jr., the vice president of the Fort Belknap Tribal Council, the reservation is smack in the middle of several major trafficking routes.


						</p>

						<p class="story">Another reason a lot of people get into selling and using drugs here in the first place is because there’s not much to do.
						</p>

						<p class="story">“There ain't nothing around,” Horse Capture, Jr. said. “This Hi-Line is suffering nowadays because it's not the way it used to be years ago.”


						</p>

						<p class="story">The boredom is real. Unemployment is close to 12 percent on the reservation, compared to 4 percent in Montana.


						<p class="story">Then there are the jurisdictional gaps - tribal laws versus state laws versus federal - which are pretty easy to exploit. They make Indian Country more attractive as a target market and even tougher places to deal with the supply.


						</p>


						<p class="story">Kirk’s grown up dealing with the fallout. “I have family that are well known drug users, and I love my family, I'm a very family-oriented person,” she said.


						</p>


						<p class="story">And for a while, she was addicted to pills. Her husband - meth. They’re both clean now, but when she moved back home after spending a few years away, she saw a bad scene that had become worse.

						</p>

						<p class="story">Kirk and her sister, Charmayne Healy, were fed up. They felt like everyone else had given up, and they worried about their kids falling into the same trap.

 </p>

						<p class="story">So the two of them went to tribal leaders last year and said - someone needs to do something. Now.



						</p>


						<p class="story">Horse Capture Jr., the vice president, heard them. With his help, the sisters persuaded the council to declare a state of emergency against methamphetamine last January. This hadn’t been done before.

						</p>

						<p class="story">“You know other reservations, they're vanishing their people,” said Horse Capture, Jr. “But do we want to view our people as a problem? Or do we want to view them as our responsibility?”

						</p>

						<p class="story">Helped also find some start-up funds - $150,00 from a tribally owned profit-sharing venture - and asked Kirk and Healy to put together a program to battle the drug.

						<p class="story">So they got to work.

						</p>


						<p class="story">Thirty year-old Jessica Healy sat recently in the cafeteria of an elementary school in Lodge Pole – one of the towns on the reservation.

 </p>

						<p class="story">Every Wednesday night, she comes here for the Life Givers Circle - a group for Native American women dealing with addiction and codependency. It’s one of about four peer support groups that Kirk and Charmayne Healy helped start. This one is led my Miranda Kirk’s mom.

						</p>

						<p class="story">“We talk about stuff and we make ribbon skirts, activities, and we just help each other out,” said Jessica Healy.


						</p>

						<p class="story">Healy’s been using drugs, including methamphetamine, on and off since she was about 18. A little over a year ago, her only son was taken away. That’s when she found out about the Aaniiih Nakoda Anti-Drug Movement.


						</p>

						<p class="story">“They helped me and it took a big step, a big old jump, it took all that I had,” Healy said. “But it was a good feeling to be clean and to be close to people that had been going through the same thing and to know that there's others out there.”

						</p>

						<p class="story">That’s the idea behind what’s called the peer recovery movement. Groups are run by those who have succeeded in recovering from their own addictions and are often best equipped to coach others.



						</p>

						<p class="story">Kirk never expected to become the co-founder of an anti-drug organization. But when it became clear she and her sister would have to be the ones to do something, this model just clicked.


						</p>



						<p class="story">For her, it was her church family that helped her get clean.



						</p>

						<p class="story">“They’d been there. That made it easier for me to be able to express myself and not feel judged, or condemned, or like I'm a horrible person for what I was going through…And it made me stronger in the end,” said Kirk.

						</p>

						<p class="story">A growing body of research has found that people who complete peer recovery programs don’t relapse as often. They’re charged with fewer crimes and have fewer re-hospitalizations.

						</p>
						<p class="story">And, it saves money. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, for every dollar spent on treatment and recovery services, about $12 are saved because someone isn’t going back to jail, or to the emergency room.



						</p>
						<p class="story">Dyani Bingham, who runs the Transitional Recovery and Culture Project for the Billings-based Rocky Mountain Tribal Leadership Council, said she’s impressed with what’s going on in Fort Belknap.

						</p>


						<p class="story">“Miranda and Charmayne were doing peer recovery support before they even realized they were doing peer recovery support,” she said.
						</p>


						<p class="story">The Tribal Leadership Council, which is a catchall advocacy group representing 13 tribes and tribal councils, had actually tried to start a similar program at the Fort Belknap CDC - the Chemical Dependency Center - a few years ago. The CDC is the only outpatient treatment facility on the reservation. It’s run by Indian Health Services and most people get there through court order. Mostly because of a lack of funds and buy-in, the CDC project didn’t stick.

						</p>


						<p class="story">“It’s sometimes hard for people to come out of the closet in terms of being in recovery. There's still a lot of stigma. I don't think that's specific to Indian country,” said Bingham.

						</p>


						<p class="story">Bingham added the fact that the two sisters are well known, respected and trusted community members who really understand the strengths and challenges in Fort Belknap is probably why they succeeded where others didn’t.

						</p>


						<p class="story">But the Aaniiih Nakoda Anti-Drug movement isn’t just about providing a support system for recovering addicts, or helping them navigate the maze of treatment and healthcare on and off the reservation. They also go into schools and talk to kids about prevention. They help organize events like Zombie walks, where people pretend to be the drug-addled walking dead, to raise awareness around meth and other drugs. Through these efforts, and sharing their stories, they’re slowly changing the narrative here.

						</p>


						<p class="story">“Miranda and Charmayne were doing peer recovery support before they even realized they were doing peer recovery support,” she said.
						</p>


						<p class="story">One year in to the work six clients have met all of the requirements, and they’re still sticking with their recovery goals. Kirk was planning for two.

						</p>


						<p class="story">“It's a small, a very small dent,” said Kirk, “but I'm excited because if we can have six in a year, then maybe we can double those results this year. I'm really optimistic about it.”

						</p>


						<p class="story">Still, recruiting and paying peer mentors continues to be a challenge for Kirk’s organization and others like it.

						</p>

						<p class="story">But, at least their timing is good.

						</p>

						<p class="story">At the end of March, Governor Steve Bullock signed Senate Bill 62 into law, which provides a certification process and clear standards for peer support specialists. Thirty-six other states have similar programs in place.
						</p>

						<p class="story">Jim Hajny, the executive director of the Montana Peer Network, a nonprofit in Livingston, said this is huge for the recovery movement here, and will help build a real workforce.

						</p>

						<p class="story">“It was always looked at as just this grassroots thing. It's so much more than that,” said Hajny. “Once you start paying a person to do something, you are a professional. That adds a lot of credence now to the work we do and it opens the door for funding through Medicaid, but it also opens the door to private funding, through private insurance.”

						</p>

						<p class="story">While the new law is a crucial first step in legitimizing the peer support field, it doesn’t fix the cash flow issues for locally based programs that do peer recovery.

						</p>

						<p class="story">Miranda Kirk and Charmayne Healy plan to incorporate as a nonprofit, partially to find more funding streams, partially to be insulated from any shifting political whims on tribal council.

						</p>

						<p class="story">“Within the tribe, sometimes it's hard because you're related to everybody. So, if you're related to someone and you're servicing them, that can cause a problem. And it's hard because addiction doesn't discriminate. So I don't see why we should,” Kirk said.
						</p>

						<p class="story">But Jessica Healy, client zero at Fort Belknap, said that what’s important is for people to start where they are and to start reaching out.

						</p>

						<p class="story">“I just think that everyone in the community, even if some people are using, they need to step up and be like, ‘hey, there's something else out there. There’s a job. There's a group. There's this Aaniiih Nakoda Anti-Drug Movement and they could help you. They'll support you in everything that you want to do for yourself and you'll be a person that you never ever thought you could be." &#9632;
