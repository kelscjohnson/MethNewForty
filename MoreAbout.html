						The report, produced by students at the University of Montana School of Journalism, works to put a face on the new meth user base and explain the effects of an uptick in amphetamine use across the state.  The staff is made up of audio, visual and web-focused
						students in a jointly convened class working to make audio stories consumable on social media. It is an experimental capstone class led by professors Jule and Lee Banville with support from the University of Montana Journalism School. With national
						news organization partnerships, the feature is set to come out in May 2017. Follow @mtmetheffect on <a href="http://facebook.com/mtmetheffect">Facebook,</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/mtmetheffect/"> Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mtmetheffect"> Instagram.</a>
